The summit of the Ironroot Range stretches out, a rugged landscape of jagged peaks and steep, snow-capped slopes. The path narrows, forcing you to pick your way carefully between the boulders and treacherous rocky outcroppings. Wisps of cloud drift across the sky, casting shifting shadows over the harsh, windswept terrain. The sound of the howling gusts is almost deafening, and you have to brace yourself against the biting chill.",

Gnarled, twisted trees cling to the steep slopes, their bare branches reaching up as if pleading for the sun's warmth.
